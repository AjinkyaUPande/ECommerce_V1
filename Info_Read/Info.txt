Framework

1) Analysis
2) Design & Implementation
3) Execution
4) Maintenance - git, github , jenkins

Note ->

From workspace(Own device) to Local repository[Git] aka 'Commit'
From Local Repository to the Remote repository[GitHub] aka 'Push'
The code push by some other Workspace you can pull from the Remote Repository -> 'Pull'

Workspace ->

C:\Users\apande\PycharmProjects\nopCommerce_V1

Remote repository ->

https://github.com/AjinkyaUPande/nopCommerce_V1.git

Git Workflow ---------------

1) Git init  --> Create an empty git repo (Local Repository)

    -> .git repo get created & it is by default Hidden
    -> Created in local system (Project loc itself)

2) git config --global user.name "AjinkyaUPande"
   git config --global user.email "pandeajinkya55@gmail.com"

   -> These two commands use only 1st time when you using the git in system
   -> that means the git will remember you

3) git status --> tells status of files which are tracked, untracked, committed &
                 pushed to the remote repository
              --> use frequently what files at what stage

4)git add -A           --> Add all files to staging/indexing Area   (This proj use this firstly)
  git add fileName.txt --> to add specific file to staging
  git add *.py         --> add all files having .py extension

5) git commit -m "this is my first commit" --> commit with comment

   --> this will commit all files in the staging area to git repo

   note --> Initially all the files in red color
        --> after added to staging area it will be in green color
        --> after doing commit files get converted into white color

        --> git repo will not store the files
        --> it will stores the commit to the files only
        --> it will remember those changes

   Note -> for pushing the files to remote repo the Github process is needed to follow

----------------------
Github
----------------------

1) Create/ have account in Github
2) Login to GitHub & create the empty git repo

   -> Remote repo url
   -> https://github.com/AjinkyaUPande/nopCommerce_V1.git

6) Push your code into the remote repository

   -> git remote add origin https://github.com/AjinkyaUPande/nopCommerce_V1.git

       --> above command connect the local repo to the remote repo
       --> execute only once

   -> git push -u origin master

       --> This will push the code to the remote repository

       --> just go the project location & open git bash start doing push operation
           start with git status

7) How to update the changes inside the git.

   -> git pull origin master

      --> This command will pull all new changes which created inside git repo
          by you or anyone inside the local repository.

      --> that changes like (newly created files) will reflect in your local machine after
          running this command.

      --> pull files from remote to local

   -> Changes made in local repo in pycharm -> need to push to remote repository

      --> Go tru same process
      --> Ex -> Changes made in Readme file then

      --> git status
      --> git add <file_Name>
      --> git commit -m "changes made in <file_name>"
      --> git push -u origin

      --> put name of the file you made changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jenkins

-> Continuous Integration tool
-> Its java based application
-> Create folder as jenkins in C drive
-> put that downloaded jenkins.war file in it
-> at that location open CMD as administrator
-> run "java -jar jenkins.war"
-> if not work then run
-> "java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java"
-> until unless cmd is on you can work with the jenkins
-> It gives passkey
   --> 7bd12fccbabd45f3aab8866ecdad17e1
-> In browser open "https://localhost:8080/"
-> Ask for pass -> put the above key in that -> only 1 time use
-> Key used for unlocking jenkins
